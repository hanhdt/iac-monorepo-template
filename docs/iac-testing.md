# Pulumi IaC Testing Guide

## 1. Overview.

Pulumi is a modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define cloud resources using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python,. This document outlines the steps and best practices for testing Pulumi projects, ensuring that infrastructure is secure, functional, and reliable.

## 2. Types of IaC Testing with Pulumi.

### 2.1 Syntax Checking and Code Validation.

Pulumi's code is written in traditional programming languages, so using language-specific and formatters is the first step.


- Typescript/JavaScript: Use `eslint` and `prettier`
- Python: Use `unittest` or `pytest`

Example:

```typescript
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
import { assert } from "chai";

describe("Testing S3 Bucket", () => {
    const mockBucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("my-bucket");

    it("should create an S3 bucket", async () => {
        const name = await mockBucket.id.apply(id => id);
        assert.isString(name, "Bucket ID should be a string");
    });
});
```

### 2.3 Integration Testing

Integration tests involve deploying the infrastructure in a real environment and verifying it behaves as expected.

- Publumi CLI: You can test infrastructure by deploying it to a sandbox or staging environment using `pulumi up` and verifying with cloud SDKs

Steps:
1. Deploy the stack to test environment: `pulumi up --stack <test-env>`
2. Run verification using your test framework.

### 2.4 Security Testing

Pulumi integrates with common cloud security tools and services to scan for potential issues.

- Pulumi also has built-in support for policy-as-code using Pulumi's CrossGuard feature

Example:
```typescript
import * as policy from "@pulumi/policy";

policy.validateResource("aws:s3/bucket:Bucket", (args, reportViolation) => {
    if (!args.name.startsWith("secure-")) {
        reportViolation("S3 bucket names should start with 'secure-' for security purposes.");
    }
});

```

### 2.5 End-to-end Testing (E2E)

E2E tests simulates real-world usage, ensuring that infrastructure and application work together.

Steps:
1. Deploy the infrastructure using `pulumi up`.
2. Run application-level tests, like API tests or database queries, to ensure the infrastructure is functioning.

You can use frameworks like Cypress or Postman in combination with infrastructure created by Pulumi.

## 3. Recommended Tools for Pulumi Testing

- Unit Tests: Use `jest`, `mocha` for TypeScript
- Security Scans: Use `Checkov`, `tfsec`, or Pulumi's CrossGuard for policy enforcement.
- Cloud SDKs: Use AWS SDK to verify the resources post-deployment.

## 4. Setting Up IaC Testing in CI/CD.

You can automate Pulumi tests within CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent infrastructure quality.
Here's how to integrate testing in a pipeline:

### 4.1 Pre-Deployment Testing.

#### 1. Code Linting

Run language-specific linters: `eslint`, `pylint`

#### 2. Unit Tests:

Execute unit tests with mock cloud resources.
Example:
```bash
npm run test
```

#### 3. Security Testing:

Perform security checks with `checkov` or Pulumi CrossGuard.

```bash
checkov -d .
```

### 4.2 Post-Deployment Testing

#### 1. Deploy infrastructure to Test Environment:
```bash
pulumi up --stack dev --non-interactive --yes
```

#### 2. Integration Tests:

Use Pulumi's SDK to verify resources after deployment or use cloud SDKs.

```bash
npm run integration-tests
```

#### 3. Clean-up:

Ensure the test environment is destroyed after testing to avoid costs.

```bash
pulumi destroy --stack dev --yes
```

### 4.3 Example CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Lint and Test
        script:
          - npm run lint
          - npm test
    - step:
        name: Deploy to Test Environment
        script:
          - pulumi up --stack dev --non-interactive --yes
    - step:
        name: Run Integration Tests
        script:
          - npm run integration-tests
    - step:
        name: Clean-up Test Environment
        script:
          - pulumi destroy --stack dev --non-interactive --yes

```

## 5. Best Practices for IaC Testing with Pulumi

- **Modular Testing**: Write unit tests for individual Pulumi components or stacks.
- **Automation**: Integrate all tests (unit, integration, security) into your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Mocking Resources**: Use Pulumi's mocking framework for unit tests to avoid provisioning real infrastructure.
- **Use Policy-as-Code**: Define security and compliance checks using Pulumi CrossGuard.
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always clean up resources in test environments to minimize costs.

## 6. Conclusion

Testing is a vital aspect of managing infrastructure with Pulumi. By incorporating various type of testing into your workflow, you ensure that your cloud resources are deployed securely, efficiently, and as expected.
